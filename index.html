<h1 style="text-align: center;">Hello there!</h1>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am Mythical Tea Beast, welcome to my website.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Have a look around and see if anything interests you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Here's something to keep you around for a moment:</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 163px;" border="1">

<tr style="height: 109px;">
<td style="width: 50%; height: 109px;">&lsquo;<a title="Autism voices article" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01549-1">I am not a broken version of normal&rsquo; &mdash; autistic people argue for a stronger voice in research</a></td>
<td style="width: 50%; height: 109px;">This article made me proud and sad. I hadn't heard of the 2021 Lancet report, I'm shocked that it actually happened. It has made me realise that I'd appreciate being a more active Autism awareness advocate.</td>

<p style="text-align: center;">Things I have been doing recently:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="text-align: center;">I have been learning a little bit of German. It's going okay so far.</li>
<li style="text-align: center;">Reading more often. Currently I'm reading Sapiens and it's good although it makes me want to find the papers and read them instead.</li>
<li style="text-align: center;">Being a little bit more active on LinkedIn for work. I haven't worked out how I want to use it yet though.</li>
<li style="text-align: center;">I've been doing some crafts and painted some stones recently which was actually very fun and silly.</li>
<li style="text-align: center;">Trying to be a little better at keeping on top of organising all the photos I take. This is not going so well as I have been on holiday recently!</li>
